## üìå Steps

### 1. Take Ownership
Open Command Prompt as **Administrator**, then run:
```bash
takeown /f "E:\Windows" /r /d y
````

### 2. Grant Full Permissions

Grant full control to the administrators group:

```bash
icacls "E:\Windows" /grant administrators:F /t
```

### 3. Try Deleting the Folder

Use one of these commands to delete the folder:

```bash
rd /s /q "E:\Windows"
```

or

```bash
rmdir /s /q "E:\Windows"
```

### 4. Safe Mode (Optional)

If access is still denied, reboot into **Safe Mode** and repeat the delete steps.

### 5. Use Unlocker Tool (Optional)

If the folder remains locked, try using a third-party tool like **Unlocker** to force deletion.
